// its a divide and conquer type algorithm.
// just break down your array into small and small pieces and until you have one items in each pieces. then merge together by comparing them.
// Code Merge Sort: Merge sort has two parts. Main/First part does divide and second part is merging/combining parts. At the time of combining, parts are combined together.
// Divide: the first function named as mergeSort is actually a divide function. where an array is divided into two.
// merge: this is just merging two sorted array. Just be careful this two array could be in different size
